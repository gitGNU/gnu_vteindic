* What is VTE?

VTE is a library (libvte) implementing a terminal emulator widget for GTK+,
and a minimal sample application (vte) using that.  Vte is mainly used in
gnome-terminal, but can also be used to embed a console/terminal in games,
editors, IDEs, etc.

VTE supports Unicode and character set conversion, as well as emulating any
terminal known to the system's terminfo database.

vteindic is the extension to original VTE library for Indian Language support,
i.e., currently upstream VTE code doesn't support complex script rendering.
Current work is done with Devanagari script support.
